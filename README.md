Crack Detection Image Classifier
Overview
This project is an image classification system that uses TensorFlow to classify images as cracked (positive) or not cracked (negative). The system includes a deep learning model built with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), capable of detecting cracks in images. Additionally, a React web application is included where users can upload images and receive predictions.

For those who want to use a custom dataset, the train.ipynb Jupyter notebook is provided to train the model on their own images.

Features
Crack Detection Model: A TensorFlow-based CNN model that detects cracks in images and classifies them as either cracked or not cracked.

React Web Interface: A front-end application that allows users to upload an image and see whether the model classifies it as cracked or not.

Custom Dataset Training: The train.ipynb notebook is provided for users to train the model on their custom datasets. This allows for flexibility in detecting cracks in various types of images.

Real-Time Prediction: Users receive immediate predictions from the model, with the interface showing whether the uploaded image is positive (cracked) or negative (not cracked).

Requirements
Backend (TensorFlow Model)
Python 3.x

TensorFlow

NumPy

Matplotlib

Frontend (React Web App)
Node.js (version 14.x or higher)

React (Create React App or custom setup)

Axios (for API calls to backend)

Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ZilkyX/Crack_Detection_CNN.git
cd Crack_Detection_CNN
2. Install Dependencies for the Backend
First, navigate to the backend directory (or wherever your Python code is located) and install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Train the Model
To train the crack detection model, open the train.ipynb Jupyter notebook. The notebook provides instructions on how to train the model on your own dataset, including preprocessing steps and model training.

bash
Copy
Edit
jupyter notebook train.ipynb
Once the model is trained, it can be used for prediction.

4. Set Up the Frontend (React App)
In the frontend directory (where the React code is), install the required Node.js dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd frontend
npm install
5. Run the Backend Server
To serve the model and handle predictions, start the backend server. If you're using FastAPI, run the following:

bash
Copy
Edit
cd api
uvicorn app:app --reload
6. Run the React Web App
In the frontend directory, start the React application:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
This will launch the React app, and you should be able to interact with the web interface in your browser.

Usage
Using the React Website
Upload an Image: On the web page, click on the "Upload Image" button to select an image from your computer.

Prediction: Once the image is uploaded, the backend will process the image and use the trained model to classify it as either cracked (positive) or not cracked (negative).

View Results: The prediction will be displayed on the page, showing whether the image is positive (cracked) or negative (not cracked).

Example
Image 1: (An image showing a cracked surface) — Predicted Label: Cracked (Positive)

Image 2: (An image showing an intact surface) — Predicted Label: Not Cracked (Negative)

Model Architecture
The crack detection model is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built using TensorFlow. The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers to extract features from the image. The model then flattens the features and uses fully connected layers for classification. The final output layer uses a softmax activation function to classify images into one of two categories: cracked or not cracked.
